# How to request a checked out book from the Virginia Tech Library #

The Virginia Tech Library ensures that resources like journals and books are made available to anyone who requires the information. Resources that have been checked out can still be requested and made available to those who need them.

1. Navigate to the Virginia Tech Library page and search for your desired book in the *Summon* search bar.
