# MkDITA

Source files for my Markdown-DITA (MarkDITA) experiments.

## What's in here?

- Markdown files on how to perform tasks on the Virginia Tech library's website (developed originally for the TechCommix project)
- A DITA map for the Markdown files
- The Jekyll files that make the sweet GitHub pages view of this project possible
- My poorly coded version of Jarno Elovirta's `net.sourceforge.dita-ot.html` plug-in, with an off-canvas mobile side navigation borrowed from <http://www.bootply.com/88026>
